1.  INTRODUCTION 

The  Market  Gap  Analysis  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  Final  Year  Project  (FYP) 

preparation  for the Bachelor’s  in Information and  Communication Technology (BICT) 

program  at  Virinchi  College.  The  primary  objective  was  to  identify  unmet  needs, 

inefficiencies, or  opportunities  in  Nepal’s  freelance Information  and  Communication 

Technology  (ICT)  sector  that  can  be  addressed  through  a  web-based  solution 

leveraging technologies such as Spring Boot, React JS, MySQL, JWT, and ML libraries 

(NumPy, OpenCV,  Matplotlib,  scikit-learn)  on  Google  Colab.  The  analysis  involved 

interactions  with  freelancers  and  Codeed  Incorporated,  a  Nepal-based  software 

company, to gather professional insights  through interviews and feedback sessions. 

Initially,  the  FYP  focused on  a  basic  project  management  tool  for  freelancers,  but 

insights  from freelancers and  Codeed  Incorporated  recommended evolving  it  into  a 

comprehensive  platform,  tentatively 

titled  FreelanceHub, 

for  bidding,  project 

management,  collaboration,  and  document-based 

task  creation.  This  report 

synthesizes  findings  from  these  interactions,  identifying  gaps  in  existing  freelance 

platforms  and  proposing  a  solution  tailored  to  Nepal’s  freelance  market,  which 

contributes significantly to the economy (Institute for Integrated Development Studies 

[IIDS], 2021).  The findings  will  shape  the  FYP’s  problem  statement,  feature design, 

and  alignment  with market demands,  ensuring  a  socially  relevant  and  value-adding 

web application.

delivering  tailored,  high-quality  solutions  makes them an ideal  partner  for identifying 

market gaps relevant to this FYP (Codeed Incorporated, 2025). 

3.  PROJECT IDEA 

The  initial  project  idea  was  a  web-based  project  management  tool  for  freelancers, 

focusing  on  task  tracking  and  invoicing.  Based  on  feedback from freelancers  and 

Codeed  Incorporated,  the  project  has  evolved into  FreelanceHub,  a  comprehensive 

platform integrating  Upwork-like bidding,  Jira-like project management, collaboration 

(task commenting and file sharing), and document-based task creation using machine 

learning.  The platform aims to address  the needs  of Nepal’s freelancers by providing 

a solution  that supports  the freelance workflow from job acquisition  to project delivery 

and client collaboration. 

4.  SUMMARY OF INTERACTION 

Prior to engaging  with Codeed Incorporated, I spoke with a few freelancers who also 

currently have jobs to understand their  challenges and needs in managing  freelance 

projects  alongside  full-time  work. Their  insights  highlighted  inefficiencies  in  current 

platforms  and  the  need  for  integrated  tools.  On  15  August  2025,  I  visited  Codeed 

Incorporated  in  Lalitpur,  Nepal,  to  conduct  a  market  gap  analysis  for  my  FYP.  I 

interviewed a senior software developer and a project manager,  who provided further 

insights into the challenges and opportunities in Nepal’s freelance ICT sector. The 15-

minute  interview  was  documented  with  detailed  notes,  with  their  permission,  and 

adhered to ethical guidelines via a signed consent form. 

Key points from the interaction: 

•  Current Tools 

Codeed Incorporated develops web applications for various sectors, emphasizing AI-

driven solutions like Glyph AI and Codexa, but noted that existing freelance platforms 

(e.g.,  Upwork,  Jira,  Trello,  ClickUp)  lack  comprehensive  features  for  Nepal’s 

freelancers. Local platforms like HamroPatro Jobs focus solely on job listings and lack 

project management  or collaboration tools. 

2 

 
 
•  Challenges 

The interviewees, along with freelancers, highlighted  limitations in current platforms : 

o  Limited  Collaboration:  Platforms  like  Trello  lack  robust  client-freelancer 

collaboration features (e.g., file sharing, task commenting). 

o  Manual  Task  Creation:  No  platforms  offer  automated  task  creation  from 

documents, relying on manual input, which is time-consuming. 

o  Lack  of  Bidding  Integration:  Local  platforms  like  HamroPatro  Jobs  do  not 

integrate job bidding with project management, unlike Upwork. 

o  Limited Local Payment Integration: Lack of support for local payment gateways 

like Khalti or eSewa results in high transaction abandonment rates. 

•  Manual Processes 

Many  freelancers  rely  on  phone  calls,  emails,  or  Google  Sheets  for  project 

management,  bidding, and collaboration, leading  to inefficiencies and errors.. 

•  Desired Features 

The interviewees and freelancers recommended: 

o  Upwork-like bidding system to connect freelancers with clients. 

o  Jira-like project management with Kanban boards for task tracking. 

o  Collaboration 

tools  (task  commenting, 

file  sharing)  for  client-freelancer 

interaction. 

o  Document-based task creation using ML to streamline project setup. 

o  Local payment integration (e.g., Khalti, eSewa) for seamless transactions. 

•  Technical Preferences 

They  suggested  using  Spring  Boot  for  backend  scalability,  React  JS  for  dynamic 

frontends,  MySQL  for  data  storage,  JWT  for  security,  and  ML  libraries  (NumPy, 

OpenCV, scikit-learn) on  Google Colab  for  lightweight  document processing. Mobile 

responsiveness was emphasized due to Nepal’s high mobile usage. 

5.  IDENTIFIED GAPS/PROBLEMS 

Based on the interviews with freelancers and Codeed Incorporated, along with 

secondary research on Nepal’s freelance ICT sector, the following gaps were 

identified: 

3 

 
 
•  Limited Collaboration Features 

Tools like Trello and Jira lack integrated task commenting and file sharing, hindering 

client-freelancer collaboration,  critical for project success. 

•  Manual Task Creation 

No platforms offer automated  task creation from documents (e.g., contracts), 

requiring freelancers to manually input tasks, reducing efficiency. 

•  Lack of Integrated Bidding 

Local platforms (e.g., HamroPatro Jobs) focus on job listings but lack bidding 

integrated with project management, unlike Upwork. 

•  Limited Local Payment Integration 

Lack of support for local payment gateways like Khalti or eSewa results in high 

transaction abandonment  rates. 

•  Manual Process Dependency 

Freelancers rely on emails, phone calls, or Google Sheets for bidding,  project 

management,  and invoicing, leading to errors and inefficiencies. 

These gaps align with broader challenges in Nepal’s ICT sector, such as the need for 

integrated and efficient solutions (World Bank, 2025). 

6.  PROJECT SOLUTION 

The  proposed  FYP,  FreelanceHub,  is  a  web-based  platform  tailored  to  Nepal’s 

freelance ICT sector, addressing the identified gaps through a comprehensive solution. 

The  platform  integrates  bidding,  project management,  collaboration,  and  document-

based task creation, using the following features: 

1.  Project and Milestone Tracking 

Offer Kanban-based task management for projects and milestones, mimicking Jira’s 

functionality for task organization and tracking. 

2.  Bidding Module 

Develop an  Upwork-like job  board  for clients to post projects and freelancers to  bid, 

with search/filtering by job type or status. 

4 

 
 
3.  Time Tracking 

Allow freelancers to log task hours for billing and productivity monitoring. 

4.  Client Dashboard 

Provide clients with an interface to view project status, tasks, invoices, and collaborate 

with freelancers. 

5.  Collaboration 

Support  task  commenting  and  basic  file  sharing  (<5MB,  e.g.,  PDFs,  images)  for 

freelancer-client interaction. 

6.  Search and Filtering 

Enable searching and filtering of projects, tasks, jobs, and documents by status or type 

for improved usability. 

7.  Document Scanning and Task Creation 

Use ML to extract tasks/subtasks from uploaded documents (e.g., contracts) via OCR, 

automating  project setup. 

The solution leverages my skills in Spring Boot, React JS, MySQL, and ML libraries to 

deliver  a  scalable  platform.  By  addressing  collaboration,  automation,  bidding,  and 

payment 

integration  gaps,  FreelanceHub  aligns  with  Codeed 

Incorporated’s 

recommendations  and  Nepal’s ICT growth  goals,  such as those  in  the National  ICT 

Policy (2015). 

7.  CONCLUSION 

The  market  gap  analysis,  informed  by  interactions  with  freelancers  and  Codeed 

Incorporated,  revealed significant  opportunities  in  Nepal’s  freelance ICT sector  for a 

comprehensive  platform.  The  identified  gaps—limited  collaboration,  manual  task 

creation,  lack of bidding  integration,  and  limited  local  payment integration—highlight 

the need for an integrated solution. FreelanceHub addresses these gaps by combining 

bidding,  project management, collaboration,  and  ML-driven task  creation, tailored  to 

Nepal’s freelancers (IIDS, 2021). These findings will guide  the project’s development, 

feature  design,  and  proposal  defense,  contributing  to  a  market-driven solution  that 

enhances Nepal’s freelance ecosystem.
